shortCuts is  a tiny link shortner that helps you shortner you long URL on the go.The vision of this project is to learn about Rest APIs and impliment learnings. shortCuts has been made on top of FastAPI [web framework]. 


## Important

The applications is divided into submodules, these submodules have indipendent functions.

- **Danych** contains code for database 
- **Fief** initially contained firebase file, now contains utility functions
- **Orarin** contains scheduler code
- **Routes** has all Routes
- **Test** contains testlib and test 

shortCuts uses Postgres DB for storing relational date and MongoDB for analytics, previously realtime DB was used to store analytics data, due to extra latency migration was done.

Create a json file as **"cred.json"** at previous working directory with following schema to store connection strings. This file is refrencenced by get_cred.py submodule to get connection strings.

```json
{
  "postgres_uri": <postgres  uri>,
  "mongo_uri": <mongodb uri>
}
```
Test directory contains test functions that test overall behavior of API.
